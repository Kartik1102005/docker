	Volume :
                 We can say that are volme are like directory which are used for backup
                 
                 if a container is stopped or deleted then there will be back up of data available




       We van use volume in different tyoes:


       [ 1> assigining volume while creating Dockerfile <images> 
        
          [

            
             FROM ubuntu
        
             VOLUME ["name_of_volume"]









         ]

      2> build image from docker file --->> docker build -t my_vlo .

 
      3> now create a container andd run it  ------>> docker run -it --name cont1 my_vlo /bin/bash

      4> type ls
       
      5> we can see a folder named name_of_volume will be created

       ]
